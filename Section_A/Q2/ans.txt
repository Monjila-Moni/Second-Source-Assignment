Q:Difference between relative, absolute and fixed positoning in css with code example


The position property in CSS is used to define how an element is positioned in the document. The most commonly used values are relative, absolute, and fixed

1.position:relative;
-------------------
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.Other elements do not change their layout.It's often used as a reference point for absolutely positioned child elements.

example:
    <div style="position: relative; top: 20px; left: 30px; background: lightblue;">
      I'm moved 20px down and 30px right from where I would normally be.
    </div>

2.position:absolute;
-------------------
The element is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed.If no such ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the <html> (page itself).It is removed from the document flow (wonâ€™t affect other elements).

example:
    <div style="position: relative; height: 200px; background: #ddd;">
      Parent
      <div style="position: absolute; top: 10px; left: 10px; background: coral;">
        I'm absolutely positioned inside the parent.
      </div>
    </div>

3.position:fixed;
-----------------
The element is fixed relative to the browser window.It stays in the same place even when you scroll.It is also removed from the normal document flow.

example:
    <div style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; background: yellow;">
      I stick to the bottom-right corner even when you scroll.
    </div>
