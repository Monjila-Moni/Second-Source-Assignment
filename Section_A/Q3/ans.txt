Q: What is z-index? Describe a common real-world use case.

The z-index in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a webpage â€” that is, which elements appear in front of or behind others along the z-axis (like layers).z-index only works on elements with a position of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.Higher z-index values appear on top of lower values.If elements have the same z-index, the one that comes later in the HTML will be on top.z-index can be positive, zero, or negative.An element with z-index: -1 will go behind the normal flow.z-index applies only to elements that create a stacking context (which includes positioned elements and some others like elements with opacity < 1 or transform applied).

real-world use cases:
---------------------
1.Sticky or Fixed Header:When scrolling, the header should remain on top of all content.
  header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    z-index: 999; /* Ensure it stays above other elements */
  }
2.Dropdown Menu:Dropdowns should appear above other elements like text or images.
  .dropdown-menu {
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 100;
  }
3. Tooltips:When you hover over an element, a tooltip appears above everything.
  .tooltip {
    position: absolute;
    background: black;
    color: white;
    padding: 4px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    z-index: 9999; /* Very high to ensure visibility */
  }
4. Image Overlays or Banners:Banners, ribbons, or badges (like "Sale!" on a product card) that overlap product images.
  .badge {
    position: absolute;
    top: 8px;
    right: 8px;
    background: red;
    color: white;
    padding: 4px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    z-index: 10;
  }
