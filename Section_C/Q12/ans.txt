Q: What are the benefits of useEffect compared to class component lifecycle methods?


useEffect is a Hook introduced in React 16.8 that offers several advantages over traditional class component lifecycle methods:

1.Unified API: useEffect combines the functionality of multiple lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount) into a single, more intuitive API.

2.Separation of concerns: You can organize related logic together in multiple useEffect calls instead of splitting code across different lifecycle methods.

3.Reduced code duplication: Class components often require the same logic in both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, while useEffect handles both cases.

4.Better handling of side effects: useEffect makes side effects more explicit and easier to test.

5.Cleaner cleanup logic: Cleanup functions are returned directly from the effect that created them, keeping related code together.

6.Dependency arrays: The dependency array allows you to control when effects run, only re-executing when specific values change.
