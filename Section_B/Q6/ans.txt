Q: What are closures? Provide a simple example

A closere in JavaScript is function that remembers the scope in which it was created- even after ther outer function has finished executing. This means a closere can still access variables from its parent scope, even ehen called later in a different contex.
When a function is defined inside another function and returned or used outside, it forms a closure by "closing over" the variables of its outer functions.

ex: 
    function outerFunction() {
    let count = 0;

    return function innerFunction() {
        count++;
        console.log("Count is:", count);
    };
    }

    const counter = outerFunction();

    counter(); // Count is: 1
    counter(); // Count is: 2
    counter(); // Count is: 3
